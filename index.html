                                Landscape in UE5 (Unreal Engine 5) refers to the environment or terrain that the player interacts with in a video game or virtual world. It includes things like mountains, trees, rocks, water, and other natural features. UE5 has advanced tools for creating
                                and designing landscapes, such as the new Nanite technology which allows for highly detailed geometry and textures, and the Lumen global illumination system which provides realistic lighting and shadows. With these tools,
                                developers can create breathtaking and immersive landscapes that enhance the player's experience.

                            Fort Solis can be binged in one intense session, or played chapter by chapter like an episodic TV show. The vision of Fallen Leaf, an indie team of games industry veterans, was to create a hybrid piece of media, emphasizing
